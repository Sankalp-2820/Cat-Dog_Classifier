# Cat-Dog_Classifier
**Simple Neural Network Model to Classify Dog and Cat Images, extracted from Google Search Images**
- Extracted Dog and Cat Images from Google Image search using a Chrome Extension.
- Used OpenCV to scale, label and vectorise the images for feeding the model.
- Scaled the Image vectors using StandardScaler.
- Used PCA to reduce the dimensionality of the image vectors.
- Created a Neural Network of 4 Layers and trained the model on the data.
- Tested the test_data to get an accuracy of 77% (260 images)
